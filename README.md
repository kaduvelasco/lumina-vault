**Lumina Vault** is a high-performance [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that acts as a **structured, persistent memory** for AI assistants during software development. It enables AI models to maintain long-term memory of project goals, architectural decisions, technical stack, and progress across multiple sessions — with full support for **sub-projects** (plugins, packages, modules) within a single repository.

## 🚀 Features

- **Project & Sub-Project Organization** — manage multiple projects and nested sub-projects (plugins, modules, packages) independently, each with its own dedicated vault.
- **Auto-Discovery** — three-step resolution: reads `.luminavault.json` from the workspace (walking up the directory tree), falls back to the last used project from global config, and guides the user when nothing is found.
- **Sub-Project Detection** — place the AI in any sub-folder and it automatically identifies which sub-project (and vault) to use based on relative path matching.
- **Custom Vault Paths** — store memory anywhere on the system; supports `~`, `$HOME`, and `HOME` shortcuts. Sub-project vaults are fully independent paths.
- **Atomic Writes** — write-then-rename pattern prevents file corruption on concurrent access.
- **Context-Aware Search** — grep-style search with configurable context lines.
- **Health Monitoring** — audit tool that identifies incomplete documentation.
- **Observability** — real-time logging to `stderr` without breaking the MCP protocol.
- **Robust Validation** — strict input schema validation powered by [Zod](https://zod.dev/).

## 🛠️ Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_projects` | List all projects managed in the vault |
| `create_project` | Create a new project with standard memory files |
| `delete_project` | Remove a project from the vault |
| `list_files` | List memory files within a project; use `metadata=true` to include size, estimated tokens, and last modified date |
| `init_project_memory` | Guided initialization of a project or sub-project knowledge base |
| `read_memory` | Read a memory file |
| `write_memory` | Overwrite a memory file |
| `append_memory` | Append entries to a file without overwriting. Content appended to `progress.md` or `decisions.md` must include a `## YYYY-MM-DD` date header |
| `archive_memory` | Move entries older than N days from `progress.md` or `decisions.md` to a sibling archive file, keeping the active file lean without losing history |
| `delete_memory` | Delete a custom memory file |
| `search_memory` | Search across the vault with context line support |
| `load_project_context` | Consolidate project memory into a single context block; use `files` to load only specific files |
| `check_project_health` | Audit project memory completeness |
| `get_vault_config` | Show current vault configuration and global settings |
| `update_project_memory` | Save session work to the vault in a single call (progress, decisions, next steps, etc.) |

## ⚙️ Auto-Discovery

When `project` is not explicitly provided, all tools resolve it automatically in three steps:

```
1. workspace_root provided → walk up directories to find .luminavault.json
   → match relative path to detect active sub-project
2. No .luminavault.json found → read ~/.lumina-vault/config.json (last used project)
3. Neither found → return a message asking the user for project name / vault path
```

Every successful operation persists the active project as `lastProject` in `~/.lumina-vault/config.json`, so the next session picks it up automatically.

When auto-discovery is used, the tool response includes a note:
- `[project: subproject1, from .luminavault.json]` — discovered from local config
- `[project: subproject1, from last session]` — recovered from global config

## 📁 Projects & Sub-Projects

### Single Project

The simplest case: one project per repository. Run `init_project_memory` with `workspace_root` and a `.luminavault.json` is created at the project root:

```json
{
  "project": "project1",
  "path": "HOME/.lumina-vault/knowledge"
}
```

### Sub-Projects

For repositories with multiple independent components (plugins, monorepo packages, modules, etc.), the root `.luminavault.json` registers each sub-project with its own vault path and relative folder key:

```json
{
  "project": "project1",
  "path": "HOME/.lumina-vault/knowledge",
  "subprojects": {
    "module/subproject1": {
      "project": "subproject1",
      "path": "HOME/.lumina-vault/knowledge"
    },
    "module/subproject2": {
      "project": "subproject2",
      "path": "HOME/.lumina-vault/knowledge"
    },
    "reports/subproject3": {
      "project": "subproject3",
      "path": "/custom/path/for/subproject3"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** sub-project vaults are independent — they can be stored at any path, not necessarily inside the parent project's vault.

### How Sub-Project Detection Works

The tool receives `workspace_root` (the directory where the AI is currently working) and:

1. Walks up the directory tree until it finds `.luminavault.json`
2. Computes the relative path from the config location to `workspace_root`
3. Matches that path against the `subprojects` keys (longest match wins)
4. Uses the matching sub-project's vault

| `workspace_root` | Result |
|---|---|
| `/path/project1` | Root project `project1` |
| `/path/project1/module/subproject1` | Sub-project `subproject1` |
| `/path/project1/module/subproject1/subdir` | Sub-project `subproject1` (prefix match) |
| `/path/project1/reports/subproject3` | Sub-project `subproject3` |

### Registering a New Sub-Project

When `init_project_memory` is called with a `workspace_root` that is **inside** a project (an ancestor `.luminavault.json` exists) but **not yet registered** as a sub-project:

1. Creates the vault for the new sub-project
2. Automatically registers it in the parent's `.luminavault.json`
3. Does **not** create a `.luminavault.json` in the sub-project folder

To store the sub-project vault at a custom location, pass the `path` argument explicitly.

### Vault Path Configuration

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| Global override | Set the `LUMINAVAULT_BASE_PATH` environment variable |
| Per-tool override | Pass the optional `path` parameter to any tool |
| Shortcut support | Use `~`, `$HOME`, or `HOME` at the start of any path |

Default storage location: `~/.lumina-vault/knowledge`

## 🌐 Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LUMINAVAULT_BASE_PATH` | `~/.lumina-vault/knowledge` | Override the default vault storage path. Supports `~`, `$HOME`, and `HOME` shortcuts. |

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for a commented template.

  }
}
```

## 💡 Prompt Examples

The following prompts work directly with the tools exposed by Lumina Vault.

---

### Saving Session Work (vague prompt)

> Update the memory of the subproject1 project.

The AI will call `load_project_context` to read the current vault state, analyze the conversation, and then call `update_project_memory` with the categorized content:

```
update_project_memory({
  project: "subproject1",
  progress: "## 2026-04-23\n- Implemented feature X\n- Files: src/service.ts, src/client.ts",
  decisions: "## 2026-04-23\n- Chose approach A over approach B for better performance and maintainability",
  next_steps: "## Now\n- Write unit tests for feature X\n- Document the integration flow"
})
```

Fields written by **appending** (logs — history is never lost):
- `progress` → `progress.md`
- `decisions` → `decisions.md`

Fields written by **overwriting** (always reflect the current state):
- `next_steps` → `next_steps.md`
- `memory` → `memory.md`
- `architecture` → `architecture.md`
- `stack` → `stack.md`

Fields with **configurable mode** (default: append):
- `custom` → array of `{ filename, content, mode? }` — any `.md` file outside the standard set; `mode: "append"` (default) or `mode: "write"`

---

### Initializing a Top-Level Project

> Initialize the memory vault for a new project. Use `init_project_memory` with: project name "project1", workspace_root "/path/project1", auto_detect true. Then summarize what was detected.

---

### Initializing a Sub-Project

> I'm starting work on the subproject1 module. Use `init_project_memory` with workspace_root "/path/project1/module/subproject1" and project "subproject1". Register it as a sub-project and use the default vault path.

---

### Auto-Detecting the Active Sub-Project

> I'm working in the folder "/path/project1/module/subproject2". Use `load_project_context` with workspace_root "/path/project1/module/subproject2" — the tool should detect which sub-project is active and load its vault automatically.

---

### Resuming Work After a Break

> I'm back to work. Use `load_project_context` with workspace_root "/path/project1/module/subproject1" to reload the context for the subproject1 module and summarize: last completed task, next steps, and any open decisions.

---

### Recording an Architectural Decision in a Sub-Project

> We decided to use approach A instead of approach B for subproject1. Use `append_memory` with workspace_root "/path/project1/module/subproject1" and filename "decisions.md". Record: what was decided, why, and what was rejected.

---

### Updating Progress in a Sub-Project

> I just finished the core service for subproject1. Use `append_memory` with workspace_root "/path/project1/module/subproject1" and filename "progress.md". Include today's date, what was done, and the files changed: `src/service.ts` and `src/client.ts`.

---

### Searching Across All Sub-Projects

> Search the project1 vault for the keyword "authentication" with 3 lines of context. I want to see how each module handles authentication.

---

### Searching Within a Specific Sub-Project

> Search for "database" in the subproject3 module only. Use `search_memory` with workspace_root "/path/project1/reports/subproject3" and query "database", with 2 lines of context.

---

### Comparing Sub-Projects

> Use `load_project_context` for both "subproject1" and "subproject2" projects. Compare their next steps and tell me which one has more critical pending work.

---

### Health Check Across a Sub-Project

> Use `check_project_health` with workspace_root "/path/project1/reports/subproject3" to verify if the subproject3 vault is complete. List missing or empty files and suggest what each should contain.

---

### Documenting the Stack for a Sub-Project

> Use `write_memory` with workspace_root "/path/project1/module/subproject1" and filename "stack.md". Document the stack: language and version, main framework, key libraries, database, and testing tools.

---

### Listing All Sub-Projects

> Use `list_projects` to show all vaults in the vault. Then tell me which ones correspond to project1 sub-projects based on their names.

---

### Removing a Sub-Project

Sub-projects are auto-detected by scanning the vault for subdirectories that contain standard memory files. There is no registration to remove.

- If you deleted the source folder but want to keep the vault data, no action is needed — the sub-project will still appear in `list_projects` as long as its vault files exist.
- If you want to permanently delete the vault data, use `delete_project` with both `project` and `subproject`:

> Delete the vault for the subproject1 module under project1.

---

### Writing Custom Memory Files

> Use `update_project_memory` with project "subproject1" and the `custom` field to overwrite the API documentation and append to the testing log:

```
update_project_memory({
  project: "subproject1",
  custom: [
    { filename: "api.md", content: "# REST API\n## Endpoints\n...", mode: "write" },
    { filename: "testing.md", content: "## 2026-04-23\n- Added unit tests for feature X" }
  ]
})
```

## 🖥️ CLI Reference

The `lumina-vault` binary exposes commands for installation and vault configuration.

### `install [target]`

Automatically configure lumina-vault as an MCP server in your AI tools. Supported targets: `claude`, `gemini`, `codex`, `opencode`, `windsurf`, `cursor`, `zed`, `cline`.

```bash
# Install in all supported tools (prompts for confirmation)
lumina-vault install

# Install in a specific tool
lumina-vault install claude
lumina-vault install gemini
lumina-vault install codex
lumina-vault install opencode
lumina-vault install windsurf
lumina-vault install cursor
lumina-vault install zed
lumina-vault install cline
```

CLI-based targets (`claude`, `gemini`, `codex`, `opencode`, `windsurf`) are skipped if the tool is not found in `PATH`. File-based targets (`cursor`, `zed`, `cline`) are skipped if the tool's configuration directory does not exist.

---

### `config set-vault <path>`

Set the global default vault path. Accepts `~`, `$HOME`, and `HOME` shortcuts.

```bash
lumina-vault config set-vault ~/.lumina-vault/knowledge
lumina-vault config set-vault HOME/my-vaults
lumina-vault config set-vault /absolute/custom/path
```

### `config get-vault`

Display the currently configured global vault path.

```bash
lumina-vault config get-vault
# Global vault path: /home/user/.lumina-vault/knowledge
```

### `config unset-vault`

Remove the global vault configuration and revert to the default path (`~/.lumina-vault/knowledge`).

```bash
lumina-vault config unset-vault
# Global vault path removed. Using default.
```

> **Note:** the global vault path set via CLI is read by the MCP server at startup. After changing it, restart the MCP server in your client.
